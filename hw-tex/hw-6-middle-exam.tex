\emph{p.44}: (8) \quad
Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a \textit{wf.} $((\neg p_1 \to p_2) \to (p_1 \to \neg p_2))$. 
Show that $L^+$, obtained by including this $\mathscr{A}$ as a new axiom, has a larger set of theorems than $L$. Is $L^+$ a consistent extension of $L$?

\emph{p.44}: (10) \quad
Let $L^{++}$ be the extension of $L$ obtained by including as a fourth axiom \textit{scheme}:
\[
( (\neg \mathscr{A} \to \mathscr{B}) \to (\mathscr{A} \to \neg \mathscr{B})).
\]
Show that $L^{++}$ is inconsistent. (Hint: see Chapter 1 exercise 7 (p.10))
